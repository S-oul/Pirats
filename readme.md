# Pirats : A Technical Test Game to be recruted by.


## The Game : 

In this game, you play as the captain of the "Pirats" (not pirates) and must assign tasks to your crew.

These tasks will help your ship move faster or just defend it from other pirats.

Once an enemy vessel gets too close and your cannons are unloaded… it's over.

Use A and D to slightly move the camera.
